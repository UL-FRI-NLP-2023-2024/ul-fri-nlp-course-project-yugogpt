As such, there are certain things that a monk would unlikely own, and these limitations have significant implications for their spiritual practice and community. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Personal possessions: Monks typically do not own personal possessions such as clothes, jewelry, or other worldly items. This is because they have renounced attachment to material things and have dedicated their lives to spiritual pursuits. The lack of personal possessions means that monks do not have to worry about material needs, and they can focus on their spiritual practice and service to the community.\n2. Money: Monks often live in poverty, meaning they do not have any money or financial assets. This is because they believe that material wealth is a distraction from spiritual pursuits and can lead to attachment and greed. By living in poverty, monks are able to focus on their spiritual practice and service to others without being burdened by financial concerns.\n3. Technology: Monasteries are often technology-free zones, and monks are discouraged from using electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, or televisions. This is because technology can be a distraction from spiritual practice and can lead to attachment to the external world. By avoiding technology, monks can focus on their inner spiritual practice and cultivate a sense of detachment from the external world.\n4. Family: Monks take vows of celibacy and do not have families. This means that they do not have spouses or children, and they are free to devote themselves fully to their spiritual practice. The lack of family ties allows monks to focus on their spiritual development and service to the community without being distracted by personal relationships.\n5. Worldly activities: Monks are discouraged from engaging in worldly activities such as work, entertainment, or socializing. This is because these activities are seen as distractions from spiritual practice and can lead to attachment to the external world. By avoiding worldly activities, monks can focus on their spiritual practice and cultivate a sense of detachment from the external world.\n\nThe implications of these limitations are significant for a monk's spiritual practice and community. By renouncing material possessions and personal attachments, monks are able to cultivate a sense of detachment and inner peace. This allows them to focus on their spiritual practice and serve their community with greater devotion and dedication. The lack of personal possessions and financial concerns also allows monks to live simply and humbly, without being burdened by material needs.\n\nFurthermore, the limitations on a monk's ownership and engagement in worldly activities allow them to cultivate a sense of detachment from the external world and to focus on their inner spiritual practice. This can lead to a deeper sense of spiritual awareness and connection to the divine, which can benefit not only the individual monk but also the larger community.\n\nIn summary, the limitations on a monk's ownership and engagement in worldly activities are essential for their spiritual practice and community. By renouncing material possessions and personal attachments, monks are able to cultivate a sense of detachment and inner peace, which allows them to focus on their spiritual practice and serve their community with greater devotion and dedication.", "pred": "?", "answer": 0.0, "ans": false, "mutator": "[INST]\nHelp a system solve the question by modifying/adding instructions based on the following rule:\nAsk for Opinions/Analysis: If the original prompt only asks for a fact, such as 'What is X?', the improved prompt could be, 'What is X, and what are its implications for Y?'\n\nQ: Name something a monk probably would not own.\n\n[/INST]\nNew Q:"}, {"ID": 3, "question": "Name something you are likely making if you buy milk, eggs, sugar and cream.\nAnswer Choices:", "whole_pred": " Hmm, that's a tough choice!

Gigantor was even bigger than I had imagined, its leaves shimmering in the fading light. I approached it cautiously, feeling the ground tremble beneath my feet as its power surged.\n\nGigantor spoke in a low, rumbling voice, its words echoing in my mind. \"Why do you seek me, adventurer?\" it asked. \"What is it you desire?\"\n\nI hesitated, unsure of how to answer.
