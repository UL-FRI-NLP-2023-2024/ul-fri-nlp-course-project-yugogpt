    "whole_pred": " Let's think step by step. Something that keeps children safe could be:\n\n1. Seatbelts in cars: This keeps children safe while traveling in a car by preventing them from being thrown around or injured in the event of an accident.\n2. Car seats: These are designed specifically for young children and provide a safe place for them to sit while traveling in a car.\n3. Baby monitors: These allow parents to keep an eye on their baby while they are in another room, ensuring that they are safe and secure.\n4. Safety gates: These are used to block off stairs, rooms, or other areas that may be dangerous for children to access, preventing them from falling or getting injured.\n5. Life jackets: These are used for children who are near water, such as at the beach or pool, to keep them safe in case they fall into the water.\n6. Bike helmets: These are worn by children when they are riding bikes to protect their heads in case of a fall or collision.\n7. Playground equipment: Many playgrounds have safety surfacing, such as wood chips or rubber, to cushion children in case they fall while playing.\n8. First aid kits: These are used to treat minor injuries, such as cuts or scrapes, that children may sustain while playing or exploring.\n9. Emergency contact information: Having this information readily available can help ensure that children are safe and that someone can be contacted in case of an emergency.\n10. Home security systems: These can include features such as door and window sensors, motion detectors, and video cameras, which can help keep children safe in their home.",
