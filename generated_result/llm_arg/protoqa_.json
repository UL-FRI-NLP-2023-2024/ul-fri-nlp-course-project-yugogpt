Broccoli florets can reach sizes of up to 6-8 inches in diameter, making them some of the largest vegetable florets around. In contrast, cauliflower, eggplant, and zucchini typically reach sizes of up to 12 inches in diameter, which is significantly smaller than broccoli.\n\nBroccoli's large size is due to its fast growth rate and high yield. It is a cool-season crop that thrives in temperatures between 60-70\u00b0F (15-21\u00b0C), and it can be harvested in as little as 55 days after planting.
